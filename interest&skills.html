          <h2>Information Assurance & Security</h2>
          <p>I'm interested with the three core principles for developing and implementing effective security policies
            and strategies to protect data and information systems.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Confidentiality</b> ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and preventing
            unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
          <p><b>Integrity</b> maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with
            or corrupted in an unauthorized manner.</p>
          <p><b>Availability</b> guarantees that authorized users have reliable and timely access to information and
            systems when they need it.</p>
